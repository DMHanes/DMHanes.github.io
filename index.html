  <div class="centerimg"><img src="darb.jpg" alt="Me!" style="width:300px;height:400px;margin: 0 auto;"></div>
  <p class="centertext"><br>Hello! I'm Darby, a senior at Texas Tech University pursuing dual majors in applied physics and electrical engineering. I thrive on challenges and am deeply involved in my academic community through leadership and peer mentoring. I am particularly passionate about applying my skills, and have heavily participated in extracurriculars surrounding aerospace and biomedical engineering. Outside of academics, you'll find me immersed in a good book with a cup of tea or exploring new places. I'm eager to contribute my passion for innovation and problem-solving to a dynamic team.<br><br></p>

  <h2>Skills</h2>
  <article>        
    <section class = "container">
    <div class="column"> 
      <h3>Physics</h3>
      The best part of my physics degree was the hands-on laboratory course with rigorous two-week experimental rotations (covered in the projects section). Theory courses also include statistical, advanced classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, partial differential equations, special relativity, scientific data analysis, optics, electricity and magnetism and thermal physics.
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h3>Engineering</h3>
      A degree in electrical engineering has granted me a good balance between hardware and software skills. The curriculum has included both senior-level theory courses and hands-on projects. Also, I followed my passions and began teaching myself aerospace and biomedical engineering. I've made filters, rovers and have extensive experience with laboratory equipment. I also enjoy PCB design and have experience with Altium. In addition, I have experience with Arduinos, Raspberry Pis and the MSP430 microcontroller. 
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h3>Programming</h3>
      I've taught myself some languages, and also have taken many classes. I have experience integrating these solutions with real-world hardware applications. I feel comfortable with C, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, Assembly Language, MATLAB, LATEX and R. In addition, I completed an extensive project with Verilog on a Xilinx FPGA.</div>
    <div class="column">
      <h3>Professionalism</h3>
      I've participated in several leadership and mentorship programs at Texas Tech. Helping my peers is the most rewarding part of being an undergraduate student. I jump at leadership opporotunities and hold several positions currently.</div>

      <img src="jt3_logo.jpg" alt="JT4 Logo" style="max-width=100%;width:150px;height:150px;margin-left:50px;"><br><br>
      At JT4, I contributed to setting up analog tests to verify our team's adaptive filter simulations. My role involved assessing the machinery's loss and visualizing simulation data through methods like the Wigner-Ville Distribution, Frequency-Time Analysis, and Power Spectrum visualization. I also collected data to validate the accuracy of the test setup and identified the linear relationship for the Signal to Noise ratio. Additionally, I helped develop Measures of Performance and Test Matrices for the setup, and worked with spectrum analyzers, signal generators, FPGAs, and software-defined radios.</div>


    <div class="column">
      <img src="sparx.jpg" alt="Sparx Logo" style=width:150px;height:150px;margin-left:65px;><br><br>
      Sparx is a small engineering consulting firm where I’ve gained valuable experience over several summer and winter breaks as an intern in the electrical engineering department. During these times, I often stepped in to handle tasks while engineers were on vacation. My responsibilities included rewiring the building’s security system, spending over 50 hours soldering, validating and editing numerous schematics, and designing and assembling my own PCB from scratch. I was fortunate to have amazing mentors who provided guidance and left me strong recommendations on LinkedIn. <href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/darby-hanes/details/recommendations/?detailScreenTabIndex=0">(View Recommendations here)</href></div>

      <img src="rep.png" alt="US Congress Seal" style=width:150px;height:150px;margin-left:60px><br><br>
    When I was 16 and a freshman at Texas Tech, I interned in the Lubbock office of the Honorable Jodey Arrington. This experience was quite different from anything I had done before. I often found myself on the phone with concerned constituents, where I learned how to de-escalate situations and ease their worries. My responsibilities also included assembling correspondence for the congressman and sending mail to constituents. I worked more hours than any other intern and gained valuable skills in balancing demanding coursework with a time-intensive job. This experience sparked my appreciation for challenges and long hours of work

      <img src="countertrace.jpg" alt="Countertrace Logo" style=width:150px;height:150px;margin-left:70px;><br><br>
        Countertrace is the chemical engineering development department at Sparx, where I had the opportunity to work in a fully equipped wet lab. I conducted various tests, with thin layer chromatography being the most common. I quickly became proficient at calibrating machinery and frequently worked with the luminometer and infrared spectrometer. Throughout my time there, I ensured that safe laboratory standards were consistently maintained.

  <h2>Peer Mentoring</h2>
  <div>
  <h3 style="text-align:center;"><br><br>Circuits Tutor <br> Texas Tech Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</h3>
  <p style="text-align:center;margin-right:400px;margin-left:400px;">For 1.5 years, I tutored circuits, leading exam reviews, proctoring exams, and creating project solution keys. However, the most rewarding part was mentoring other students. Circuits is a challenging course, and I was thrilled to help a few students grasp concepts like node voltage, mesh current, and AC current analysis. This experience stands out as one of the highlights of my time at Texas Tech University.

<div>
    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Calculus Learning Assistant <br> Texas Tech STEM Teaching, Engagement and Pedagogy</h3>
    <p style="text-align:center;margin-right:400px;margin-left:400px;">As a Learning Assistant (LA), I tutored calculus for two semesters, supporting large classes. In the first semester, I worked in an online section with over 100 students. Out of the 8 LAs, my breakout room consistently attracted the most students. I developed the ability to balance answering individual questions while providing broader help with practice problems, ensuring that everyone received the support they needed. </p>
