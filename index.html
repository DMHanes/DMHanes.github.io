  <h1 id="typing-text">Hi, I'm Darby</h1>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
  <div class="centerimg"><img src="darb.jpg" alt="Me!"></div>
  <p class="centertext">Hello! I'm Darby, a senior at Texas Tech University pursuing dual majors in applied physics and electrical engineering. I thrive on challenges and am deeply involved in my academic community through leadership and peer mentoring. I am particularly passionate about applying my skills, and have heavily participated in extracurriculars surrounding aerospace and biomedical engineering. Outside of academics, you'll find me immersed in a good book with a cup of tea or exploring new places. I'm eager to contribute my passion for innovation and problem-solving to a dynamic team.</p>

<section id="skills">
  <h2>Skills</h2>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="column">
      <h3>Physics</h3>
      I've completed advanced coursework in physics including statistical and thermal physics, advanced classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, partial differential equations, special relativity, scientific data analysis, optics, electricity and magnetism. I have also taken an advanced laboratory course with 2-week long experimental rotations.
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h3>Engineering</h3>
      I've picked up a balanced skillset between software and hardware in my engineering degree. In addition, I have begun teaching myself aerospace and biomedical engineering. I've taken both senior level theory courses and had hands-on projects. I've made filters, rovers and used Arduino and MSP430 microcontrollers. I also enjoy PCB design and have experience with Altium.
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h3>Programming</h3>
      I've taught myself some languages, and also have taken many classes. I have experience integrating these solutions with real-world hardware applications. I feel comfortable with C, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, Assembly Language, MATLAB, LATEX and R. In addition, I completed an extensive project with Verilog on a Xilinx FPGA.
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h3>Professionalism</h3>
      I've participated in several leadership and mentorship programs at Texas Tech. Helping my peers is the most rewarding part of being an undergraduate student. I jump at leadership opportunities and hold several positions currently.

  <h2>Experience</h2>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="column">
      <img src="jt3_logo.jpg" alt="JT4 Logo">
      My work at JT4 focused on setting up analog test to confirm my team's adaptive filter simulations. I determined the loss on the machinery used and visualized simulation data using the Wigner-Ville Distribution, Frequency Time Analysis and the Power Spectrum visualization. Finally, I took data, validating an accurate test setup. I determined the linear relationship for the Signal to Noise ratio. Part of my responsibilities also included creating Measures of Performance and Test Matrices for the setup. I worked with spectrum analyzers, signal generators, FPGAs and software defined radios.
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <img src="sparx.jpg" alt="Sparx Logo">
      Sparx is a small engineering consulting firm that I've spent a long time at. Over my summer and winter breaks, I interned in the electrical engineering department. With engineers out on vacation, I was often tasked with picking up their jobs while they were away. I rewired the building's security system, spent 50+ hours soldering, validated and edited a myriad of schematics, as well as designed and assembled my own PCB from scratch. I had amazing mentors, and they left me stellar recommendations on LinkedIn (also visible here).
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <img src="rep.png" alt="US Congress Seal">
      I interned in the Honorable Jodey Arrington's Lubbock office when I was 16 years old, during my freshman year at Texas Tech. It is very different than anything I have done before. I was often on the phone with irritated constituents and had to de-escalate the situation and calm their worries. In addition, I assembled correspondence for the congressman, as well as sent mail to constituents. I worked more hours out of all interns, and I learned how to balance challenging coursework with a time-consuming job. Now, I love challenges and working long hours (at least 10 hours a day).
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <img src="countertrace.jpg" alt="Countertrace Logo">
      Countertrace is the name of the chemical engineering development department at Sparx, equipped with a fully functioning wet lab. I performed many tests, most commonly thin layer chromatography, and became quick at calibrating machinery. I worked with the luminometer and infrared spectrometer frequently, and maintained safe laboratory standards.

  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <div class="project-container">
    <div class="project">
      <h3>Verification and Validation of LMS Adaptive Filters</h3>
      <img src="vnv.png" alt="Power Spectrum and Time Series from my V & V Project">
      <p>This was my final presentation at JT4, and a culmination of two months of hard work. The presentation includes both theoretical explanations and my analog testing results. I focused a lot on visualizing frequency-time plots. Enjoy!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project">
      <h3>8-Bit Breadboard Computer</h3>
      <img src="IMG_2106.jpg" alt="8-Bit Breadboard Computer">
      <p>Part of my Honors Modern Digital System Design capstone was assembling this Ben Eater inspired 8-bit breadboard computer. Out of all the groups, less than 30% were able to finish the project. My teammate had to drop the class, so I ended up being alone on this project for the majority of the semester. It had a working RAM, ROM, clock, registers and more.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project">
      <h3>Autonomous Rover</h3>
      <img src="IMG_2571.jpg" alt="Autonomous Rover">
      <p>I programmed this rover with a Xilinx BASYS 3 FPGA board, and it was capable of autonomous motion, line detection, and ball shooting. I created several movement algorithms during the evolution of the project. Most of my code is available on my GitHub repository. In addition, I designed an overcurrent protection circuit and PWM control program.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project">
      <h3>Intermediate Physics Lab</h3>
      <img src="IMG_2571.jpg" alt="Intermediate Physics Lab">
      <p>Intermediate physics lab is the pinnacle of the physics curriculum at Texas Tech. The course consists of two week-long experimental rotations where students are given little instruction and many physics-related questions to answer experimentally. I kept a logbook, detailing the results of the complex experiments in this class.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project">
      <h3>Signal Testing PCB Design</h3>
      <img src="PCB.jpg" alt="Signal Testing PCB Design">
      <p>I created this PCB during my electrical engineering internship at Sparx Engineering. It contains adjustable low pass, high pass, and amplifier circuits. The low pass and high pass can be connected to form a band pass circuit as well. I designed and assembled this PCB on my own. I taught myself Altium and PCB design, and got expert opinion from electrical engineers during the design process.</p>
